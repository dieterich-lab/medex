# MedEx - Medical Data Explorer
This project provides a dashboard tool to allow a quick exploratory data analysis of datasets.
It was developed to allow a quick insight into our medical research-data-warehouse without the need of knowing how to use SQL or programming languages. 
However, it is not limited to clinical data, but can be used to do exploratory data analysis on many kind of datasets. 

## Setup ##
We highly recommend the setup via docker-compose. The installation via pip is only recommended for developers.

### Data Import   [(detailed documentation)](https://github.com/dieterich-lab/medex/tree/master/documentation)
* Database imports run every night at 5:05 and at startup.
* The database is only updated if there is new data to import.
* In order to add new data add a new `entities.csv` and `dataset.csv` to the `./import` folder.
* The `entities.csv` and `dataset.csv` files should look like in directory `dataset_examples`.
